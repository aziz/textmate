Beware, some of these will take over some of your global keyboard shortcuts. It doesn't interfere with anything I use obviously since I use all this stuff.

Balance Jr is the most useful thing evar. I have it bound to @home@ and @end@

h2. Live Preview of HTML, CSS & Source Code

# Open the Web Preview Window from the Window menu.
# Set your pipe through script to @"$HOME/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/subtleGradient.tmBundle/Support/bin/42_TextMate_live_preview.rb"@ _including quotes_
** You might have to adjust the path to wherever you install your bundles.

Then it'll automatically refresh as you edit your code. It does a clickable diff of your unsaved changes in source files. It sets the @<base>@ tag of any html file to your @$TM_PROJECT_SITEURL@. And it previews your CSS by injecting it into a @<style>@ tag inside the html of whatever url is in the file @/tmp/42_tm_css_live_preview_url.stupid_way_to_save_info@. It might do some other stuff too, but I completely forget now.

Oh yeah, it also does a live render of your Textile or Markdown documents and runs your javascript code. It's all based on the current language selected for your file.
