## Install

The quickest way to install the bundle is via the command line. If you have Git installed, you'll probably want to install with Git. With or without, you can simply copy and paste each line one by one into the Terminal instructions ( lifted from [drnic](http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle) ):

### Install with Git

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git@github.com:svnlto/css3please.tmbundle.git "CSS3 Please.tmbundle"
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
