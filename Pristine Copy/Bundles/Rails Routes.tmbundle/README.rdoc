This is a {TextMate}[http://macromates.com/] bundle that provides a couple of functions for working with {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.org/]' {named routes}[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html]. The functions currently are:

* go to named route action or view -- <code>Cmd-P</code>
* go to named route action -- <code>Ctrl-Cmd-P</code>
* go to named route view -- <code>Opt-Cmd-P</code>
* go to <code>routes.rb</code> -- <code>Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-R</code>

= Usage

If the selected text (or word under cursor) looks like a named route expression in your controller or view code, e.g:

  edit_user_path(@user)
  root_path
  post_comment_url(@post, @comment)
  new_publisher_magazine_photo_url

you can press <code>Cmd-P</code> to go to the action or view associated with this route (the choices are presented in a popup menu). You can also press <code>Opt-Cmd-P</code> to go directly to the view file or <code>Ctrl-Cmd-P</code> to go directly to the action.

= Installation

  mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  git clone git://github.com/szeryf/rails-routes.tmbundle.git
  osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

= Troubleshooting

Normally when you press any of the shortcuts, you should see a progress bar saying "Loading routes.rb" for a moment (exactly how long depends on your project and <code>routes.rb</code> size). If it says "Loading environment.rb" instead and stays considerably longer, there may be a problem with your <code>routes.rb</code> depending on something that is loaded by <code>environment.rb</code> file (in one of my projects it was a config class). So, if you want to speed up these operations, make sure that your <code>routes.rb</code> can be <code>require</code>d without <code>require</code>ing <code>environment.rb</code> first (which takes notoriously long in most Rails projects).

To check this, run <code>irb</code> (NOT <code>script/console</code>) in your project directory and try issuing the following:

  >> require 'config/boot.rb'
  => true
  >> require 'action_controller'
  => true
  >> require 'config/routes.rb'
  => []

If this goes without errors, you should be good to go. If you get some errors, there is something missing for <code>routes.rb</code>. You'll have to examine those errors and fix them if possible.

= Compatibility

Tested with Rails 2.3.5. Should work with any Rails 2.x version (if it doesn't let me know). May not work with Rails 3 (I haven't tested it) but patches welcome.

= To do

* a command to go to route definition inside <code>routes.rb</code>
* action names in menu for controller
* separate menu sections for views, controller, route definitions
* make it faster (somehow cache the routes?)
